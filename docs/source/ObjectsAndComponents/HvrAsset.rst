HvrAsset
===========

The purpose of a HvrAsset object is to store the data for an HvrActor to play. A HvrAsset acts most like a MovieTexture, AudioClip or an Animation in Unity.

Unless manually creating HvrActors using code, this object will not be encountered when creating scenes as they are automatically created behind the scenes for HvrActors when actors are assigned data.
