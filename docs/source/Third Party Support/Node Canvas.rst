Node Canvas
===============

Node Canvas is a third party plugin for creating a complete visual behaviour authoring framework for Unity, it is available on the Unity Asset Store here. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14914


Within the ‘8i Unity Plugin’ download folder there is a zip folder under ‘8i/Integrations’ which includes our integration for the Node Canvas plugin. The script is fully functional and can be used with the current version of Node Canvas (as of writing, version: 2.5.6c, Oct 25, 2016).

For an introduction to Node Canvas, example scenes can be found here. http://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/downloads/
